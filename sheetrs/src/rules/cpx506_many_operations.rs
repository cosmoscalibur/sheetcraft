//! CPX506: Many Operations detection

//! Description: Detects formulas with an excessive number of mathematical or logical operations.
//!
//! Violations for this rule are emitted by [`cpx504_deep_if_nesting::DeepIfNestingRule::on_cell`]
//! as part of the CPX5xx dependency cascade. This struct is registered as a walker
//! rule only for configuration enable/disable.

/// This walker rule is a no-op. Actual violations are emitted by CPX504's
