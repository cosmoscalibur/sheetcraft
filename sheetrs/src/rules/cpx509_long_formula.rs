//! CPX509: Long formula detection

//! Description: Excessively long formulas are hard to read, maintain, and debug.
//!
//! Violations for this rule are emitted by [`cpx504_deep_if_nesting::DeepIfNestingRule::on_cell`]
//! as part of the CPX5xx dependency cascade. This struct is registered as a walker
//! rule only for configuration enable/disable.
